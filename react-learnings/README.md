### The benefits of ReactJS and reasons to choose it for your project
#### Speed

> The React basically allows developers to utilize individual parts of their application on both client-side and the server-side, which ultimately boosts the speed of the development process.

> In simple terms, different developers can write individual parts and all changes made wonâ€™t cause the logic of the application.

#### Flexibility

> Compared to other frontend frameworks, the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure. This flexibility, in turn, saves huge amount of time and cost to businesses.

#### Performance

> React JS was designed to provide high performance in mind. The core of the framework offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which makes complex apps run extremely fast.
